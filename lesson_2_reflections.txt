What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initialising a repository allows you to use version control in a directory. It creates a .git file within the directory.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is a middle ground between the two. It allows you to create logical and finished commits.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Staging area can be used as an intermediary to create a logical commit.
